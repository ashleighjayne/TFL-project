#TFL Project

This is a personal project I have created based around Transport For London's API, using ReactJS and ES2015. It is a work in progress.

## Setup
This setup requires NPM to install packages so please ensure you have node and npm installed.

First, clone the repo from Git and run:

```js
$ npm install
```

To compile stylesheets, run:

```js
$ npm run build-sass
```

To build Webpack, run:
```js
$ npm run webpack
```

And to start the server, run:

```js
$ npm run start-server
```

The website should now be viewable at http://localhost:3000/


## Notes


## Setup Issues
In case of any issues with setup, the packages can be individually installed:

```js
$ npm install express
$ npm install nodemon
$ npm install npm-sass
$ npm install react react-dom
$ npm install babel-core babel-loader webpack
$ npm install babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react
$ npm install webpack-dev-server
```
